MCP3424
=======

library for the Arduino.

  The MCP3424 is a low-cost 18Bit Sigma-Delta ADC with I2C Interface.

  This library implements the following features:

   - channel setting by address or pin selection
   - continuous and one_shot modes
   - selectable sample rates 12,14,16 and 18 bit
   - selectable PGA gains: x1, x2, x4, x8
   - error detection: overflow, underflow, i2c, progress, timeout
   - selectable blocking/non-blocking modes
   - highest valid gain selection
   - general call signalling
